`Minecraft: Pi Edition <http://pi.minecraft.net/>`__ is awesome.

However it uses Python 2. We're moving it to Python 3 (without any official
approval) and offering it for download here.

We hope this makes people's lives easier.


Project Priorities
------------------

1. Make it work on Python 3
2. Keep compatibility with the original release
3. Make the API cleaner and more Pythonic
4. Make the internals cleaner and more Pythonic
